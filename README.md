<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a prototype of an app to help people in Indianapolis find transportation that best suits their needs. 

### Technologies
this project was made in Android Developer Studio, and utilizes Google Maps for mapping and location information. 

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

We recommend running this application in a Virtual Device from Android Studio.

### Prerequisites

To test this application out for yourself you will need to download and install Android Studio, and create a Virtual Device on which to run the application. There are no special requirements for setting up Android Studio. 

### Configuring an Android Virtual Device

### Running the Project

1. Get a Google Maps API key [from their webpage](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
2. Clone the repo.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/n-sudo/ProTeam-Transportation-08.git
```
3. Import the project into Android Developer
4. Add your API key to app/release/src/res/values/google_maps_api.xml
```
